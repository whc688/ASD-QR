All action primitives are made up of one of three options:
1. line(grasp_position, target_position)
  - This action moves the end effector to a `grasp_position` at an orientation, closes the gripper, moves from the `grasp_position` to the `target_position`, then releases the gripper.
  - This action involves moving only one object, and touching it only once. It is suitable for pick-and-places or interacting with objects with prismatic (i.e., sliding) joints.
2. curve(grasp_position, axis, angle, rotation_center)
  - Similar to the previous `line` action, but instead of moving in a straight line, it moves in a circular path, whose center is at `rotation_center`, about `axis` for the specified amount `angle` in degrees.
  - This action involves moving only one object, and touching it only once. It is suitable for interacting with objects with revolute (i.e., rotating, hinge-like) joints.
3. composite action:
  - These are actions which involves either grasping then releasing one object multiple times, moving one object in a trajectory more complex than a straight line or circle, or actions involving more than one object. 
  - The parameters of this action is the list of sub-actions which this action could be decomposed into. These sub-actions should be describable using `line` or `curve` (involves only a simple movement of a single object).

Below are some examples:
#
Task: stack the blocks on the plate
Scene: [red block, blue block, green block, plate]

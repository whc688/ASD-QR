instructions:
given an input task description, the goal is to classify whether performing the task will involve touching only "one" object or "multiple" objects.
all objects start in a de-activated state (e.g., doors, drawers, cabinets, cupboards, and other containers are closed, lights are off, etc.) unless specified otherwise (e.g., with the door opened).
after performing the task, objects should be reset to their de-activated state if possible.
